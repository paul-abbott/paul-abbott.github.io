### WGM Test  

#### DRAPED FRAMES: Summary of Theoretical and Artistic framework

It is demonstrated that the musical environment [^1] is animated by polyvalent real and imagined elements. In the context of the embodied sense of temporality and musical timing, multiple- oscillating rhythms make up organism and environment, through a mix of internal, “endogenous timebase” (pulse, heart, brain,) and ‘external’ (gestural and environmental) rhythms. [^2] It is this range, and beyond—from body to situation to score— that this research will explore.

[^1]: The ‘musical environment’ includes preparations, performance and reception.
