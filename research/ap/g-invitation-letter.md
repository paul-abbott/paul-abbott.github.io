### Letter of Invitation

Dear friends,

I have just started a research project in Antwerp titled for now: "WE GROW MUSIC! Ecologies of attention, discrepancy and multiplicity—real and imaginary—in embodied music performance." It is a practice based research project that will last around a year and a half, ending in March 2024. 

The project will be made up of a number of discrete and interacting *cycles* of activity: ONGOING PRACTICE, GROUP MUSIC, INDEPENDENT MUSIC, WORKSHOP and GUESTS.

The different activity cycles will overlap and interact, contributing in more or less direct or explicit ways to the core themes of the research.

If you are able and willing, I would like to invite you as one of the GUESTS.

It would be XXX 2022 (prob around XXX, to be precise): an independent 'presentation' (explained below) of something (of your choosing) during a day/evening. Probably in Antwerp, or Brussels. We would negotiate an appropriate venue, through conversation. Could be in/outside 'the institution'. I will pay for travel, accommodation and a fee.

I am in the process of double checking practicalities: budget amount, feasibility, but for now, if you are likely free and able, let's schedule a chat and I can explain in more detail?

Until we might talk it through, for now; to explain a little bit, the context of the invitation: this is a *summary* from my application, and is the departure point for the research:

>The subject of this research is a reconsideration of embodied music making as a complex ecology.

>This research looks at the aspects of discrepancy and multiplicity as specific generative features of embodied music making, primarily in the context of live experimental improvised music. This follows the idea of music making as an ecology, in which simultaneously real (material, sonic) and imaginary (subjective, embodied) music is grown.

The ideas here serve as an invitation, some ingredients, a start point, and an excuse - to provoke some action. In this case to begin to practically articulate and question some of what already happens, when we perform (that is play, listen to, write, imagine) music.

I conceive the research project overall is a stage, and/or garden. That is, a particular, framed space to develop conditions for the investigation of a specific kind growth (culture).

So, I am inviting a few GUESTS to *do* (perform, present) something (present in the very broadest and non-academic sense) as a kind of perpendicular (oblique, *discrepant?*) contribution to the themes of the research project. I imagine the guest contributions as being a bit like when you open a window to a room, and the outside sounds come in, being both contingent and organised, related and not.

Hope this might work out.... sorry for the long email,

Let me know!

Best,

P
