#### DRAPED FRAMES: Summary of Theoretical and Artistic framework

It is demonstrated that the musical environment [^1][^1]: The ‘musical environment’ includes preparations, performance and reception. is animated by polyvalent real and imagined elements. In the context of the embodied sense of temporality and musical timing, multiple oscillating rhythms make up organism and environment, through a mix of internal, “endogenous timebase” (pulse, heart, brain,) and ‘external’ (gestural and environmental) rhythms. ^[Riess Jones, Time Will Tell.] It is this range, and beyond—from body to situation to score— that this research will explore.

The existing content of the complex bio-musical environment will be investigated, alongside the development of original music. This will be engaged through two core themes: discrepancy and multiplicity, approached through practices of attention. The musical environment is an ecology consisting, simultaneously, of moving bodies, imaginative ideas and sonic vibrations. ^[Reybrouck, “Music as Environment.”] Moreover the music emerging from this ecology is situation specific: contingent on, co-produced by performer(s) and context. ^[Cox, Music and Embodied Cognition; Clarke, Ways of Listening: An Ecological Approach to the Perception of Musical Meaning.]
