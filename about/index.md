### About

  Paul Abbott plays with the drum kit, synthetic sounds, performance and writing. He explores music as an ecology: in which the interaction of sounds, signs and the physical body grow real and imaginary music.

  BETA His work is often concerned with developing practical and fictional structures through improvisation to encourage experimental musical play.
