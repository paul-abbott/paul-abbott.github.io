### About

  !!! check all 'creative writing' to extract something for this !!!
  !!! full rewrite in MY voice SMALL voice !!!
  !!! check AP Grow notes etc. !!!

  Paul Abbott is a musician and drummer.

  His work is focused on live experimental and improvised performance.

  He plays with the drum kit, synthetic sounds, performance and writing.

  He explores music as an ecology: in which the interaction of sounds, signs and the physical body grow real and imaginary music. His work is often concerned with creating practical and fictional structures to facilitate improvisation and experimental musical play.

 --- EDITS ---

  He plays with acoustic drum kit and synthetic sounds; algorithmic composition and performance and writing.

  His work explores music as a complex bio-semiotic ecology in which he often experiments with combinations of real and imaginary, organic and synthetic elements.

  !!! interests
  He is interested in the experience of embodied experimental improvised performance. In particular, how work in this context can grow practical and fictional structures through improvisation to encourage experimental musical play.
  ~~what sticks and what moves; stumbles and gravity; frames and waves; overlapping oscillations.~~

  !!! history
  Thanks to the great generosity of other exploratory non-musicians and musicians, Paul started the ongoing process of un/learning music, outside of traditional musical teachings, through listening and play.

  !!! ongoing practice
  Paul realised recently that, following this history, perhaps what he continues to explore is something like "an alter-practice of ongoing un-training".

  His work continues to attempt to re-find ways to
  grow practical and fictional structures through improvisation to encourage experimental musical play.
