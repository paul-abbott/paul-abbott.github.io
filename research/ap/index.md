## We Grow Music!
Ecologies of attention, discrepancy and multiplicity—real and imaginary—in embodied music performance.

## or
A reconsideration of embodied music making as a complex ecology. Practical exercises—for live improvised music—are being developed. These are based on **listening as a mode of attention** and used to investigate how performing bodies grow music and language—characterised by discrepancy and multiplicity.

## or
This research looks at the aspects of discrepancy and multiplicity as specific generative features of embodied music making, primarily in the context of live experimental improvised music. This follows the idea of music making as an ecology, in which simultaneously real (material, sonic) and imaginary (subjective, embodied) music is grown. The project engages the challenge: how to access, explore, and articulate features of the complex embodied music making process. The body is an “**intricately coordinated crowd**” and “multiple” but not “fragmented.” Through practice led research I will focus in particular on the aspect of attention as a practical guide through this ‘crowd’

### ANOTHER GARDEN or ANTEROOM

The subject of this research is a reconsideration of embodied music making as a complex ecology. In the context of improvised and experimental music, I have performed in projects where diverse elements (instrumentation, ideas, languages, bodies) were brought together.

This experience was of a complex musical ecology. This project is (another) attempt at finding new approaches, growing new frames: to practically, conceptually and theoretically explore this specific music making experience.

The themes of the project are approached practically through multiple, overlapping activities. These include independent ongoing practice, collaborative work and guest presentations. This practice is approached conceptually through the terms *discrepancy* and *multiplicity*.

The idea of *listening as a mode of attention to grow music* will be explored, to develop practical exercises—for exploring live improvised music.

What this sounds and looks like, and what is at stake, will be demonstrated through performed and recorded music, written documentation, and presentations. This musical growth will be approached as the production of a ‘living archive’ of scores, in an expanded sense. [^1]

~~The artistic and academic outcomes of this research will challenge disciplinary and idiomatic conventions, standards of practice and therefore access; it will challenge assumptions of homogeneity and raise critical questions about the production, performance and inscription of new music.~~

### PRISMS and GUIDES

~~This research looks at the aspects of *discrepancy* and *multiplicity* as specific generative features of embodied music making, primarily in the context of live experimental improvised music.~~

This project makes use of the concepts *discrepancy* and *multiplicity* to guide an exploration of generative features of embodied music making: primarily in the context of live experimental improvised music.

Specifically, the research aims to encourage an ‘open’ musical context, allowing the combination of diverse elements: conventional and unconventional musical instrumentation; acoustic and electronic sound sources; trained and untrained musicians; scored and improvised, unscripted play.

While concentrating on this primary artistic context, the project moves outside this framework, in an attempt to explode its frame; to find new ways to listen *in* to practice. This follows the idea of music making as an ecology, in which simultaneously real (material, sonic) and imaginary (subjective, embodied) music is grown.[^2] The project engages the challenge: how to access, explore, and articulate features of the complex embodied music making process.

The human body had been called an “intricately coordinated crowd” and “multiple” but not “fragmented.”[^3] Through practice led research I will focus in particular on the aspect of attention (for example *listening as a mode of attention)*[^4]  as a practical guide through this ‘crowd’.[^5]

### DRAPED FRAMES

It has been demonstrated that the musical environment (which includes preparations, performance and reception) is animated by polyvalent real and imagined elements. Taking just one aspect of this as an example: in the context of the embodied sense of *temporality* and musical timing, multiple oscillating rhythms make up organism and environment, through a mix of an internal “endogenous timebase” (pulse, heart, brain) and ‘external’ (gestural and environmental) rhythms. ^[Riess Jones, Time Will Tell.]

The musical environment is an ecology consisting, simultaneously, of moving bodies, imaginative ideas and sonic vibrations.[^6] The music emerging from this ecology is always situation specific: contingent on, co-produced by performer(s) and context.[^7]

It is the existing content of this complex bio-musical environment that this project investigates: to grow new music. It is from body to situation to score, that this research plays. Or put another way: "somewhere between heart-beat and truck joke."

This will be engaged through two core themes: *discrepancy* and *multiplicity*, approached through practices of *attention*.

I will use the concept of discrepancy to imply movement, dynamism, and critically: a challenge to standards, processes of normalisation and raising questions of perceptual filtering and subject constitution.[^8]  The concept of multiplicity exemplifies a condition of proliferation which is key to developing living, growing and accessible music.[^9]

%%attention, listening%%
The subjective perception of musical experience has been described as an attentional practice.[^10]  I will draw on theories and practices of attention[^11] starting with an expanded conception of listening to include both (1) the conventional ‘outward’ sense, where we listen to music, with our ears, to the environment, and the organised sounds which may occur within it;[^12] and (2) the ‘internal’ sense of the registration of the subjective sensations of what we understand as our body (e.g. pulse, heartbeat, breath), in reaction to the same musical environment.[^13]

Alongside artists practices, I will draw on a range of work in the fields of music cognition and perception, embodied music cognition, and supporting ideas in neuroscience.[^14]

### TRUCK JOKE

This project is *realised* through practice, including the practice of writing. I am starting from (following my PhD research on the *[emergence of sounds and signs](https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/38770/AbbottP_2022.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)*) the provocation that *writing is everything happening outside of the time based performance of musical sounds*.[^15]

Or,
>I use an expanded sense of writing, \[borrowing\] the term ‘writing plus words,’ which includes the range of signs and symbols—from words to diagrammatic marks—relating, through symbolic inscription, to verbal language systems.

That is, all the semiotic, discursive activity, directly or indirectly contributing to the production of the emerging musical environment. In total this makes up a ‘living archive’ this project is generating.

It is obvious perhaps, but: the choice of words — concepts, terms: technical or poetic  (discrepancy, multiplicity, attention) — used to think through, describe and frame the project, change the nature and output of the research investigation and the feel of any practical experiment.

There is no descriptive writing in this project (writing \[to me\] is never description). The writing (including this writing) is it's own liquid, set of emotional gravities, material thinking and feeling.

I continue, ongoing, to write and rewrite *this* description and terms for the project, alongside capturing notes (as a kind of journal) made during practice. As practical investigations stimulate shifts in my understanding of the research — and take me in new material, practical and conceptual directions — I rewrite the terms by which the project is framed and the description of the project. The form and content — *sign(s) and sound*(s) —  of the project continue to feedback and mutate — that is GROW — as it progresses.

This rewriting is one of the ways this project proceeds through iteration or what I'm calling rhythmic returns.

### INFINATE REHEARSAL

Ultimately this project is an *Infinate Rehearsal* (to quote Wilson Harris): demonstrating the ongoing growth — of *discrepancies*, *multiplicities*, ideas, sounds, feelings — across a range of material, semiotic and emotional registers.

Ideas are collections of travelling vibrations. All the ideas which flow through this research, congeal, release or stick - at any given time - serve as an invitation, some ingredients, a start point, and an excuse - to provoke some action.

The action this project tries to stimulate is to begin to practically articulate and question some of what already happens, when we perform — that is play, listen to, write, imagine — music.

### SPIRALING TWIST


After.[^16] The body of the performer—engaged in the specific dynamic physical and semiotic play that music performance necessitates—is the site of an ongoing dynamic mix of tension and generative growth between registers of language and modes of consciousness and communication.

It is not only the body which is already multiple (plural), but the context (environment) that the body is situated. That is, the body is already a collaboration: an ongoing embodied process of transition and translation between sound and sign, animating emerging music.

Performance practice is poly-temporal[^17] (repeating, off-grid, de-centred), imaginative (dramatized, metaphorical, fictional)[^18] and synthetic (mixing sound sources, symbolic registers, ideas, materials).[^19]

### DRAMATIC ENVIRONMENT

!["Dramatic Environment 1"](http://www.paulabbott.net/assets/images/ap-wgm-stage-sketch-01.jpg)

The project is realised through practice. Embodied practice. A practice of growth and rhythmic returns. Each rhythmic restart is a chance to reset: re-learn listening, reconsider claims, findings and feelings. Rhythmic returns to cultivate the growth process.

It is this practice that continues to reveal that everything in the project — material developments, conceptual architecture, theoretical administration (ideas, taxonomies, claims), aesthetic outcomes — are a set of mutable fictions.

These fictions are approached as partialities — friendly fragments, like sections of an optical lens — catalytic characters who offer new ways of re-considering what has been discovered. These fictions — as characters — are interrogated, encouraged; played with and listened to: through embodied experimental and improvised musical play.

I call this complex ecology; this collection of fictions, characters, sounds and feelings the *Dramatic Environment*. It is this environment which stages the music of this project.

~~This research explores growth as a condition — grows, develops — practical and fictional structures through improvisation to // encourage experimental musical play // . I refer to the sum total pf these structures: the total conceptual, fictional and material environment or composition as the Dramatic Environment.~~

~~I conceive the research project, overall, is a stage, and/or garden. That is, a particular, framed space to develop conditions for the investigation of a specific kind growth (culture).~~
